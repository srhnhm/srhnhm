			The Universal Sereal Bus will roam Black Rock City to surprise burners with their favorite cereals. The USB will be a roving restaurant, carrying food and seating to new destinations each day.
			<span class="spacer"></span>
			Given that many of our camp members are DJs, composers, and artists, we are also shaping the USB as an audio-visual performance space.  With aesthetics informed by outer space, technology, and the future, the USB is an embodiment of our passion for and optimism about digital culture and expression.  
			<span class="spacer"></span>
			By creating a serendipitous breakfast destination -- complete with cereal, sounds, and visuals -- we will form spontaneous communities. We hope to attract and meet lots of new people this year!

			From the time of my very first burn, I have been most inspired by the optimism and whimsy behind projects on the playa. Time and time again, I am floored by the feats of technology and physics accomplished for the sole purpose of surprising and delighting: a giant anglerfish with glinting teeth gliding along the playa, the earth-shaking stomp of The Beast, the fiery puffs of a 30-foot tall dandelion. In interacting with these creations, I was overwhelmed with gratitude and the desire to pay this sentiment forward to fellow burners.
			<span class="spacer"></span>
			From the very first brainstorms with my campmates, we wanted to evoke this same sense of optimism. Working in Silicon Valley and steeped in the ever-accelerating pace of technology, we have witnessed connections of all types forged between people and ideas. At the risk of sounding unbearably geeky, we believe that technology brings us that much closer to a bright, wondrous future. With that technologist's conviction, we wanted to express our optimism about digital creativity to Burning Man.
			<span class="spacer"></span>
			We also wanted to stay true to our roots of creating a sense of hominess and comfort on the playa. As former leaders of the Shady Waffle, we have had the privilege of serving the Burning Man community a wide array of delectable breakfast treats in our dusty, pastel dome. From vegan pancakes to gluten-free waffles to tofu scrambles, the Shady Waffle has always aimed to create a delectable oasis at Burning Man through good food and earnest hospitality.
			<span class="spacer"></span>
			But how to channel this enthusiasm for technology and comfort food? What form was it to take on the playa? We all agreed that though we had made thousands of burners happy with our full-service restaurant at the Shady Waffle, we wanted to raise the stakes of our contribution to the Burning Man community and try to reach even more people. We were ready to commit a lot of time, money, and brainpower into making something wonderful. We wanted to create something that burners would point at from afar, bike to with their friends, and be instantly rewarded upon arriving. We wanted something that would embody the serendipitous spirit of Burning Man. Clearly the only thing to do was build an art car.
			<span class="spacer"></span>
			And with that, the Universal Sereal Bus was born.
			<span class="spacer"></span>
			The Universal Sereal Bus, also known as the USB, will cruise about the playa dispensing cereal and beats to burners morning and night. Cereal, for re-energizing the body and soul. Beats because over half of our campmates are electronic musicians who want to amplify the USB experience. Burners far and wide will spot our iconic USB key sculpture. With our comfy seating and disk mount table, guests will find respite from their travels about the desert. By night, the visual artist of our group will delight visitors and passersby with projections mapped onto the car's sculptural surface.
			<span class="spacer"></span>
			By inviting guests aboard the USB, we welcome the Burning Man community to join us in imagining the bright future we see through the lens of technology.

			The USB's camp members have all committed their time and cash to carry out the basics of our vision -- fixing up the car, making it rideable, meeting basic DMV requirements, getting it cereal-ready, and transporting it to the playa.  
		<span class="spacer"></span>
			However, our imaginations are bigger than our wallets.  We've dreamed up lots of ideas and are only held back by costs.  Be galvanized by the fact that any monetary donations we receive will go directly towards the <strong style="font-style:oblique"> Awesomeness</strong> of our car, taking the form of Sound, Lights, and Cereal accoutrements.

		<h3>Concept</h3>
		<span class="spacer"></span>	
		The USB has two functional requirements: to serve up cereal and to serve up beats.
		<span class="spacer"></span>
		<img src="images/design/sketch_blk.png" style="width:75%;"></img>
		<span class="spacer"></span>
		We will have a cereal serving station on the side (where we mount the cereal tube dispensers), doubling as a DJ booth.  Adjacent is a USB key table, which will have bar stools around it.  There is ample seating on the car itself, where people can eat their cereal and hang out.  We envision an abstract, polygonal seating structure, which will double as a projection mapping surface at night.  
		<span class="spacer"></span>
		The aesthetics of the USB are informed by outer space, technology, and the future.
		<span class="spacer"></span>		
		<span class="spacer"></span>
		<h3>Safety Features</h3>
		<span class="spacer"></span>
			<ul><li>Bright lighting at the front, back, sides, and underneath the vehicle</li>
			<li>Two brightly-lit designated entry points onto the vehicle</li>
			<li>Mirrors to provide vantage points of the sides and back of the vehicle</li>
			<li>Walled seating structure to prevent people from falling off the back of the vehicle</li>
			<li>Driver's area will be physically separated from the rest of the vehicle to prevent distraction</li>
			<li>The cockpit positioned as one of the highest points on the car so as to provide the greatest vantage point</li>  
			<li>Co-pilot seat to ensure that both the driver-side and passenger-side have someone looking out</li>
			<li>A fire extinguisher and first aid kit onboard the vehicle at all times in case of emergency</li>
			<li>Easily removable engine cover to quickly address any problems as they occur</li>
			<li>The USB is easy to board and dismount and safe to ride. Since the platform section of the vehicle is only 3 feet high, boarding the vehicle doesn't pose any risk  </li>
			 <li>Our sound system will also provide a measure of safety since, in most cases, people will be able to hear the USB as well as to see its approach</li>
			<li>"Co-pilot seat" to ensure that both the driver-side and passenger-side have someone looking out</li>
